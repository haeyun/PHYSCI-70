      <p>Final Project Idea: Electronic Music Box</p>

      <p> One idea I have is to make an electronic music box, similar to the one in the video below. The music box in the video makes use of a microcontroller that controls a small MP3 module player. If I were to make this, I would want the music to start playing when I open the box and stop when I close the box using a detector switch. I like the feature of the box in the video where it plays the next song when the box is closed and reopened. I think it would also be fun to lasercut some interesting designs onto the box. This might make the project too complex, but I was also interested in the idea of adding LED lights that would react to the music like in the second video below. (I'm not sure if this would even be possible/would all fit in the box.)</p>
