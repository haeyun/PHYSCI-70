  <h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication. Mechanical Design</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p>This week's assignment was to design a kinetic sculpture. </p>

      <p>After watching some videos and projects by past students, I had two ideas. One was to emulate Sophie Webster's bird sculpture, but instead of birds, put bells that would ring at various times to maybe play short melody like chopsticks. My other idea was to build a rowing kinetic sculpture (a person rowing in a single scull). I decided to go with the rowing idea after not being able to find cheap bells with different pitches online and because rowing is a continuous movement that I understand pretty well. (I used to cox on the men's heavyweight team, so while I have never rowed in a boat before, I am familiar with the mechanism.)</p>

      <h>Research and Planning</h>
      <p>I found a few videos of Lego rowing sculptures, but none of them protrayed the full stroke accruate (catch, drive, finish), so I wanted to try to make mine as accurate as possible. (I later realized why there weren't any that were accurate - the rowing stroke is very complex.)

      Here is a video I used for rowing reference:</p>

      <p>After gaining inspiration from the video below for my rower, I made this first prototype using cardboard pieces I cut out and some stretchy string I cut from the side of my masks for the joints. Since I didn't really measure the pieces, it ended up being not perfectly symmetrical, which then affected the balance.</p>

      <p>After getting a rough sense of how I wanted the arms and legs to move, I built a sturdier version, this time making sure the pieces were exactly the same size for either side and using dowels for stability.</p>
