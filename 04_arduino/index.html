  <h3>Week 4: Microcontroller Programming</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p>This week's assignment was to program an Arduino board to do something. After watching some videos using a micrcocontroller to produce sound using a Piezo buzzer, I really wanted to try and create the Shepard tone. I figured out I would need 4 buzzers after looking at this diagram, but it seemed like I wouldn't have time to get these in time. A friend who owned an Arduino kit found a Piezo buzzer, which I got really excited about, but I couldn't figure out how to get it to sound. It also had no polarity, which I thought was weird.</p>

      <p>Still wanting to do something music related, I had the idea of visualizing music through LEDs. I would assign 1 LED to a particular note, and they would light up if a note was "played." The song I had in mind for this project was Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (the really famous one with the ominous beginning).</p>

      <p>After watching some videos demonstrating how to use multiple LEDs, I tried it out with 3, and then added 3 more while also manipulating the on/off and the delays to make it look like the beginning of the Toccata.</p>

            <source src="three_LED.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>

      <p>After some trial and error, I ended up with this:</p>

      <video controls>
            <source src="toccata.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>

      <p>Although a downside to this is that the times are all hardcoded, it was a fun first-time project with the microcontroller. If I ever get my hands on a sound sensor, it would be cool to try and use the input for the LEDs.
