      <p>While at the beginning of the semester, I had thought of doing a music box, I changed my idea to improving upon my rower that I had made from cardboard in Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication / Mechanical Design because I really liked tinkering around with mechanisms.</p>

      <p>Because I had just tried to mimic the motion during Week 3 using a very makeshift rotary to linear motion mechanism and a DC motor, I wanted to spend a bit more time fine tuning the motion.</p>

      <p>I started off revisiting my old prototype and realized it would be best to have two separate motions for the arms and the body. (I had originally just been pulling the whole thing from the arms that were attached by a rod, resulting in a violent motion and occasionally the rower becoming unseated.) Because I knew the main focus of this project would be the mechanisms, I spent a lot of time on YouTube watching different mechanism videos and also thinking about what types of motion I wanted.</p>

      <p>While I knew the exact motions I had wanted, it was difficult trying to figure out how to bring them to life. While I had wanted elbows and a diagonal motion as well as potentially circular motion around the handle of the oars, I quickly realized this would be really, really difficult with the knowledge I had.</p>

      <p>I ended up going a minimalistic route and settling for a back and forth motion with the body, which would be attached to a rack and pinion, but only utilizing one "arm" of it since I just wanted it in one direction, and about a 90 degree rotation with the arms, allowing them to move up and down. Not quite the rowing motion I had pictured in my head, but it was doable.</p>

      <p>Before heading to Fusion 360, I wanted to get a sense of how it would actually work in real life, so I made a very rough cardboard rack and pinion made out of scrap materials from our kit (the 3D printed wood parts and the timing belt to use a makeshift gear).</p>

      <p>I got a lot of help from Nathan for the Fusion 360 part for the linear part with teeth of the rack and pinion as well as for the platform it would move within. We attached a body to the linear part, with teeth on only one side since I was only utilizing the mechanism in one direction. This would all be powered by a servo motor attached to the gear.</p>

      <p>After talking more about how I wanted the arms to move with Nathan, we decided we could attach a second servo motor to the body and connect the servo to the arms, which I created using the slot function from Fusion 360 and tested using the joints function.</p>

      <p>After picking up the parts Nathan had printed, I realized there were a few roadblocks before I could put everything together. The main problem stemmed from the fact that the holes in the servo arm wouldn't line up with the holes in the main arm because they were different lengths and thus the wholes did not travel in the same path. A smaller issue was that some of the holes were not big enough for the rod.</p>

      <p>I tried to go about this a few ways. I first tried to see if it made a difference which holes the rod went through. Sadly, it didn't. Next, I tried to see if I could only put a rod through the servo arm and make it push the arms up by putting the rod just below the arms. This revealed a new problem: because the servo motor was attached on the rght side of the body, there was a balance problem.</p>

      <p>After manually enlarging the holes on the servo arm and utilizing a double-servo-arm to allow for the difference in arc by the servo arm and the regular arm and making the rod go through unevenly (going through the higher hole on the left arm).</p>
