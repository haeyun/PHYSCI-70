  <h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

  <p>Since the assignment this week was to design a small object that could not be easily made by subtractive methods, I wanted to create something with a voronoi pattern on its surface. I first tried to follow a tutorial to create a voronoi vase, but I found out that it was using a paid application. I searched up other options including the mesh add-in and the voronoi sketch generator. Since I had already created the vase object, neither add-in allowed me to easily put a voronoi pattern on the object surface. I tried to follow a tutorial on using mesh to create varonoi patterns, but it didn't end up quite working out.

  With the mesh, this is what I ended up with. It looks like what I wanted, but it turned out to be pretty useless in terms of doing anything with it.</p>

  <p>After hours of trying to create voronoi with mesh, I ended up just producing the gcode file for the vase without anything on the surface, but later I played around with the voronoi sketch generator and was able to get a plane.</p>

  <p>My sad solid vase:</p>

  <p>I think this vase couldn't be made easily by subtractie methods because of the curvatures, although I'm not well-versed in all of the different kinds of fabrication methods, so there could be an easier way to make this than 3D printing. Because of the curvatures, if I were to print this in a high quality, it would probably take a long time. I actually wasn't paying much attention to my dimensions, so when I initially uploaded it to Prusa without scaling, the estimated time to print was almost a day...</p>

  <p>For the scanning assignment, I found this app for my iPad called ScandyPro. Since my iPad didn't have LiDAR, I could only scan using the front-facing camera. After several tries, I got a pretty decent scan of a stuffed animal/pillow thing I have!
