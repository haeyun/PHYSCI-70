  <h3>Week 8: Networking</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> For this week, I started off following through the Huzzah Tutorials for LAN Server and Bluetooth. While it was at first a little tricky to actually get my hotspot connected. After figuring out the pinout of the Huzzah and connecting an LED, I was able to control the light on my server.</p>

      <p> I was also interested in using an app to connect to the Huzzah over Bluetooth, so I downloaded the BLE Scanner and tried to control the LED through that. Connecting the app to the ESP32 wasn't too bad - there was just a lot of devices detected so it involved a bit of scrolling and looking for the ESP32, but I was a bit confused at the step of going to CUSTOM SERVICE and writing something. I figured it out eventually and typed in 1 or 0 as Text, and this was able to turn the light on and off!</p>
