  <h3>About Me</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> My name is Haeyun, and I am a senior in Winthrop House studying Neuroscience with a secondary in Computer Science. I am originally from Houston, TX but was born in Chuncheon, South Korea. Outside of classes, I like to play classical and jazz piano. I am excited to be taking <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/index.html">PHYSCI-70</a>, and I hope you enjoy following my creative journey this semester! </p>
