  <h3>Week 8: Networking</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> Last week, I knew I wanted to use buzzers, so I followed the buzzer workshop on the website first and was able to get a sound playing through the buzzer. A few weeks ago, when I had tried to use the buzzer, I couldn't get it to make any sound other than a faint clicking noise. I think this was a connection issue because I was able to follow the workshop without any major problems.</p>

      <p> To create a melody, I then browsed through different examples online and played around creating short melodies after creating a "pitches.h" file with all of the frequencies I needed. </p>

      <p> For the assignment integrating one input device and one output device, I ended up with a simple buzzer-button circuit that would play a short melody when I pushed the button.</p>

      <p> For this week, I started off following through the Huzzah Tutorials for LAN Server and Bluetooth. While it was at first a little tricky to actually get my hotspot connected. After figuring out the pinout of the Huzzah and connecting an LED, I was able to control the light on my server.

      <p> I was also interested in using an app to connect to the Huzzah over Bluetooth, so I downloaded the BLE Scanner and tried to control the LED through that. Connecting the app to the ESP32 wasn't too bad - there was just a lot of devices detected so it involved a bit of scrolling and looking for the ESP32, but I was a bit confused at the step of going to CUSTOM SERVICE and writing something. I figured it out eventually and typed in 1 or 0 as Text, and this was able to turn the light on and off!
