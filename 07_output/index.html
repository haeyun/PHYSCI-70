  <h3>Week 7: Electronic Input Devices</h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> Last week, I knew I wanted to use buzzers, so I followed the buzzer workshop on the website first and was able to get a sound playing through the buzzer. A few weeks ago, when I had tried to use the buzzer, I couldn't get it to make any sound other than a faint clicking noise. I think this was a connection issue because I was able to follow the workshop without any major problems.</p>

      <p> To create a melody, I then browsed through different examples online and played around creating short melodies after creating a "pitches.h" file with all of the frequencies I needed. </p>

      <p> For the assignment integrating one input device and one output device, I ended up with a simple buzzer-button circuit that would play a short melody when I pushed the button.</p>
